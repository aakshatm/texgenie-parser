## 4 Equations  

Equations in LATEX can either be inline or on-a-line by itself (“display equations”). For inline equations use the $\$.23$ commands. E.g.: The equation $H\psi=E\psi$ is written via the command $\$123,456,789$ .  

For display equations (with auto generated equation numbers) one can use the equation or align environments:  

$$
\|\tilde{X}(k)\|^{2}\leq\frac{\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{p}\left\|\tilde{Y}_{i}(k)\right\|^{2}+\displaystyle\sum_{j=1}^{q}\left\|\tilde{Z}_{j}(k)\right\|^{2}}{p+q}.
$$  

where,  

$$
\begin{array}{l}{{\displaystyle D_{\mu}=\partial_{\mu}-i g\frac{\lambda^{a}}{2}A_{\mu}^{a}}}\\ {{\displaystyle F_{\mu\nu}^{a}=\partial_{\mu}A_{\nu}^{a}-\partial_{\nu}A_{\mu}^{a}+g f^{a b c}A_{\mu}^{b}A_{\nu}^{a}}}\end{array}
$$  

Notice the use of \nonumber in the align environment at the end of each line, except the last, so as not to produce equation numbers on lines where no equation numbers are required. The \label{} command should only be used at the last line of an align environment where \nonumber is not used.  

$$
Y_{\infty}=\left({\frac{m}{\mathrm{GeV}}}\right)^{-3}\left[1+{\frac{3\ln(m/\mathrm{GeV})}{15}}+{\frac{\ln(c_{2}/5)}{15}}\right]
$$  

The class file also supports the use of \mathbb{}, \mathscr{} and \mathcal{} commands. As such \mathbb{R}, \mathscr{R} and \mathcal{R} produces $\mathbb{R}$ , $\mathcal{R}$ and $\mathcal{R}$ respectively (refer Subsubsection 3.1.1).  

## 5 Tables  

Tables can be inserted via the normal table and tabular environment. To put footnotes inside tables you should use \footnotetext[]{...} tag. The footnote appears just below the table itself (refer Tables 1 and 2). For the corresponding footnotemark use \footnotemark[...]  

Table 1 Caption text

The input format for the above table is as follows:  

\begin{table}[<placement-specifier>]

In case of double column layout, tables which do not fit in single column width should be set to full text width. For this, you need to use \begin{table\*} ... \end{table\*} instead of \begin{table} . \end{table} environment. Lengthy tables which do not fit in textwidth should be set as rotated table. For this, you need to use \begin{sidewaystable} .. \end{sidewaystable} instead of \begin{table\*} ... \end{table\*} environment. This environment puts tables rotated to single column width. For tables rotated to double column width, use \begin{sidewaystable\*} . \end{sidewaystable\*}.  

## 6 Figures  

As per the LATEX standards you need to use eps images for LATEX compilation and pdf/jpg/png images for PDFLaTeX compilation. This is one of the major difference between LATEX and PDFLaTeX. Each image should be from a single input .eps/vector image file. Avoid using subfigures. The command for inserting images for LATEX and PDFLaTeX can be generalized. The package used to insert images in LaTeX/PDFLaTeX is the graphicx package. Figures can be inserted via the normal figure environment as shown in the below example:  

\begin{figure}[<placement-specifier>]   
\centering   
\includegraphics{<eps-file>}   
\caption{<figure-caption>}\label{<figure-label>}   
\end{figure}  

In case of double column layout, the above format puts figure captions/images to single column width. To get spanned images, we need to provide \begin{figure\*} ... \end{figure\*}.  

For sample purpose, we have included the width of images in the optional argument of \includegraphics tag. Please ignore this.  

Table 3 Tables which are too long to fit, should be written using the “sidewaystable” environment as shown here   


<html><body><table><tr><td rowspan="6"></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>A Ａ AA 084 006</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>dxa o F 776</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>196</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr></table></body></html>

## 7 Algorithms, Program codes and Listings  

Packages algorithm, algorithmicx and algpseudocode are used for setting algorithms in LATEX using the format:  

\begin{algorithm}   
\caption{<alg-caption>}\label{<alg-label>}   
\begin{algorithmic}[1]   
\end{algorithmic}   
\end{algorithm}  

You may refer above listed package documentations for more details before setting algorithm environment. For program codes, the “program” package is required and the command to be used is \begin{program} .. \end{program}. A fast exponentiation procedure:  

begin for $i:=1$ to 10 step 1 do $\mathsf{e x p t}(2,i)$ ; newline() od Comments will be set flush to the right margin   
where   
proc $\mathsf{e x p t}(x,n)\ \equiv$ $z:=1$ ; do if $n=0$ then exit fi; do if $\mathsf{o d d}(n)$ then exit fi; comment: This is a comment statement; $n:=n/2$ ; $x:=x*x$ od; $\{n>0\}$ ; $n:=n-1;\ z:=z*x\circ$ d; print $(z)$ .   
end  

Similarly, for listings, use the listings package. \begin{lstlisting} \end{lstlisting} is used to set environments similar to verbatim environment. Refer to the lstlisting package documentation for more details.

end ;

## 8 Cross referencing  

Environments such as figure, table, equation and align can have a label declared via the \label{#label} command. For figures and table environments use the \label{} command inside or just below the \caption{} command. You can then use the \ref{#label} command to cross-reference them. As an example, consider the label declared for Figure 1 which is \label{fig1}. To crossreference it, use the command Figure \ref{fig1}, for which it comes up as “Figure 1”.  

To reference line numbers in an algorithm, consider the label declared for the line number 2 of Algorithm 1 is \label{algln2}. To cross-reference it, use the command \ref{algln2} for which it comes up as line 2 of Algorithm 1.  

### 8.1 Details on reference citations  

Standard LATEX permits only numerical citations. To support both numerical and author-year citations this template uses natbib LATEX package. For style guidance please refer to the template user manual.  

Here is an example for \cite{...}: [1]. Another example for \citep{...}: [2]. For author-year citation mode, \cite{...} prints Jones et al. (1990) and \citep{...} prints (Jones et al., 1990).  

All cited bib entries are printed at the end of this article: [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11] and [12].  

## 9 Examples for theorem like environments  

For theorem like environments, we require amsthm package. There are three types of predefined theorem styles exists—thmstyleone, thmstyletwo and thmstylethree  

<html><body><table><tr><td>thmstyleone</td><td>Numbered, theorem head in bold font and theorem text in italic style</td></tr><tr><td>thmstyletwo</td><td>Numbered, theorem head in roman font and theorem text in italic style</td></tr><tr><td>thmstylethree</td><td>Numbered, theorem head in bold font and theorem text in roman style</td></tr></table></body></html>  

For mathematics journals, theorem styles can be included as shown in the following examples:

## 11 Discussion  

Discussions should be brief and focused. In some disciplines use of Discussion or ‘Conclusion’ is interchangeable. It is not mandatory to use both. Some journals prefer a section ‘Results and Discussion’ followed by a section ‘Conclusion’. Please refer to Journal-level guidance for any specific requirements.  

## 12 Conclusion  

Conclusions may be used to restate your hypothesis or research question, restate your major findings, explain the relevance and the added value of your work, highlight any limitations of your study, describe future directions for research and recommendations.  

In some disciplines use of Discussion or ’Conclusion’ is interchangeable. It is not mandatory to use both. Please refer to Journal-level guidance for any specific requirements.
